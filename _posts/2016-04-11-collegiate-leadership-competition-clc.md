The purpose of the Collegiate Leadership Competition (CLC) is to

create a leadership "practice field." One that is analogous to

those in sports or the rehearsal rooms in the performing arts. CLC

is designed to address a gnawing gap in the field of leader

education and learning: the lack of a robust "practice field" where

student leaders can apply what they're learning in a context that

challenges and stretches them to the boundaries of their

knowledge, skills and abilities.

1\. Offer participating students an experience that will forever 

shape their lives and leadership practice

2\. Measure and assess whether creating a leadership practice 

field and competition increases the cognitive, affective and 

behavioral complexity of the student participants

3\. Contribute new knowledge to the field of leadership education 

and learning

4\. Create and disseminate new experiential opportunities that 

increase the knowledge, skills and abilities of student leaders

5\. Inspire and invite student groups from across the globe to 

participate in CLC
